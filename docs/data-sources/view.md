# launchdarkly_view (Data Source)

Provides a LaunchDarkly view data source.

This data source allows you to retrieve view information from your LaunchDarkly organization. Views are used to organize and group related feature flags, making it easier for teams to manage flags by business context or deployment unit.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic view data source usage
data "launchdarkly_view" "team_view" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = "frontend-team"
}

# Use the view information in other resources
resource "launchdarkly_view_links" "additional_flags" {
  project_key = data.launchdarkly_view.team_view.project_key
  view_key    = data.launchdarkly_view.team_view.key
  
  flags = [
    "new-feature-flag",
    "experimental-ui"
  ]
}

# Output the flags linked to this view
output "linked_flags" {
  description = "Feature flags linked to the team view"
  value       = data.launchdarkly_view.team_view.linked_flags
}

# Example using the view data for conditional logic
locals {
  has_linked_flags = length(data.launchdarkly_view.team_view.linked_flags) > 0
}

output "view_status" {
  value = local.has_linked_flags ? "View has linked flags" : "View is empty"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The unique view key.
- `project_key` (String) The view's project key.

### Read-Only

- `archived` (Boolean) Whether the view is archived.
- `description` (String) The view's description.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `linked_flags` (List of String) A list of feature flag keys that are linked to this view.
- `name` (String) The view's human-readable name.
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with the view.

## Usage Notes

### Discovery with Linked Flags
The `linked_flags` field provides discovery functionality, allowing you to:

- **Audit view contents**: See which flags are currently associated with a view
- **Conditional logic**: Make decisions based on whether a view has linked flags
- **Dynamic linking**: Use the current flag list to make incremental changes

### Integration Examples

```terraform
# Check if specific flags are in a view
data "launchdarkly_view" "deployment_view" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = "deployment-flags"
}

locals {
  required_flags = ["feature-toggle", "rollback-switch"]
  missing_flags = setsubtract(
    toset(local.required_flags),
    toset(data.launchdarkly_view.deployment_view.linked_flags)
  )
}

# Add missing flags to the view
resource "launchdarkly_view_links" "ensure_deployment_flags" {
  count = length(local.missing_flags) > 0 ? 1 : 0
  
  project_key = "example-project"
  view_key    = "deployment-flags"
  
  flags = concat(
    data.launchdarkly_view.deployment_view.linked_flags,
    local.missing_flags
  )
  
  comment = "Ensuring required deployment flags are present"
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use for auditing**: Leverage `linked_flags` to understand view contents
2. **Conditional resources**: Create resources based on view state
3. **Documentation**: Use view data in outputs for team visibility
4. **Integration**: Combine with other data sources for comprehensive flag management
