data "launchdarkly_project" "example" {
  key = "example-project"
}

- `name` - The project's name.

- `client_side_availability` - **Deprecated** A map describing which client-side SDKs can use new flags by default. To learn more, read [Nested Client-Side Availability Block](#nested-client-side-availability-block).
Please migrate to `default_client_side_availability` to maintain future compatability.

- `default_client_side_availability` - A block describing which client-side SDKs can use new flags by default. To learn more, read [Nested Client-Side Availability Block](#nested-client-side-availability-block).
