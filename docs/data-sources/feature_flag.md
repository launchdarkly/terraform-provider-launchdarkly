## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The unique feature flag key that references the flag in your application code.
- `project_key` (String) The feature flag's project key.

### Read-Only

- `archived` (Boolean) Specifies whether the flag is archived or not. Note that you cannot create a new flag that is archived, but can update a flag to be archived.
- `client_side_availability` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--client_side_availability))
- `custom_properties` (Set of Object) List of nested blocks describing the feature flag's [custom properties](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/connecting/custom-properties) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--custom_properties))
- `defaults` (List of Object) A block containing the indices of the variations to be used as the default on and off variations in all new environments. Flag configurations in existing environments will not be changed nor updated if the configuration block is removed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--defaults))
- `description` (String) The feature flag's description.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `include_in_snippet` (Boolean, Deprecated) Specifies whether this flag should be made available to the client-side JavaScript SDK using the client-side Id. This value gets its default from your project configuration if not set. `include_in_snippet` is now deprecated. Please migrate to `client_side_availability.using_environment_id` to maintain future compatibility.
- `maintainer_id` (String) The feature flag maintainer's 24 character alphanumeric team member ID. If not set, it will automatically be or stay set to the member ID associated with the API key used by your LaunchDarkly Terraform provider or the most recently-set maintainer.
- `name` (String) The feature flag's human-readable name
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.
- `temporary` (Boolean) Specifies whether the flag is a temporary flag.
- `variation_type` (String) The uniform type for all variations. Can be either "boolean", "string", "number", or "json".
- `variations` (List of Object) An array of possible variations for the flag (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--variations))
