# launchdarkly_feature_flag (Data Source)

Provides a LaunchDarkly feature flag data source.

This data source allows you to retrieve feature flag information from your LaunchDarkly organization.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic feature flag data source usage
data "launchdarkly_feature_flag" "example" {
  key         = "example-flag"
  project_key = "example-project"
}

# Use the views field for discovery and integration
data "launchdarkly_feature_flag" "checkout_flag" {
  key         = "checkout-redesign"
  project_key = "example-project"
}

# Output which views contain this flag
output "flag_views" {
  description = "Views that contain the checkout flag"
  value       = data.launchdarkly_feature_flag.checkout_flag.views
}

# Conditional logic based on view membership
locals {
  is_in_production_view = contains(
    data.launchdarkly_feature_flag.checkout_flag.views,
    "production-ready-flags"
  )
}

# Example: Add flag to a view if it's not already there
resource "launchdarkly_view_links" "ensure_flag_in_view" {
  count = local.is_in_production_view ? 0 : 1
  
  project_key = "example-project"
  view_key    = "production-ready-flags"
  
  flags = concat(
    # Get existing flags in the view (would require separate data source)
    ["checkout-redesign"],  # Add our flag
  )
  
  comment = "Adding checkout flag to production view"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The unique feature flag key that references the flag in your application code.
- `project_key` (String) The feature flag's project key.

### Optional

- `maintainer_id` (String) The feature flag maintainer's 24 character alphanumeric team member ID. `maintainer_team_key` cannot be set if `maintainer_id` is set. If neither is set, it will automatically be or stay set to the member ID associated with the API key used by your LaunchDarkly Terraform provider or the most recently-set maintainer.
- `maintainer_team_key` (String) The key of the associated team that maintains this feature flag. `maintainer_id` cannot be set if `maintainer_team_key` is set

### Read-Only

- `archived` (Boolean) Specifies whether the flag is archived or not. Note that you cannot create a new flag that is archived, but can update a flag to be archived.
- `client_side_availability` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--client_side_availability))
- `custom_properties` (Set of Object) List of nested blocks describing the feature flag's [custom properties](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/connecting/custom-properties) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--custom_properties))
- `defaults` (List of Object) A block containing the indices of the variations to be used as the default on and off variations in all new environments. Flag configurations in existing environments will not be changed nor updated if the configuration block is removed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--defaults))
- `description` (String) The feature flag's description.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `include_in_snippet` (Boolean, Deprecated) Specifies whether this flag should be made available to the client-side JavaScript SDK using the client-side Id. This value gets its default from your project configuration if not set. `include_in_snippet` is now deprecated. Please migrate to `client_side_availability.using_environment_id` to maintain future compatibility.
- `name` (String) The feature flag's human-readable name
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.
- `temporary` (Boolean) Specifies whether the flag is a temporary flag.
- `variation_type` (String) The uniform type for all variations. Can be either "boolean", "string", "number", or "json".
- `variations` (List of Object) An array of possible variations for the flag (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--variations))
- `views` (List of String) A list of view keys that this feature flag is linked to.

## Usage Notes

### Discovery with Views
The `views` field provides discovery functionality, allowing you to:

- **Audit flag placement**: See which views currently contain a specific flag
- **Conditional logic**: Make decisions based on flag view membership
- **Integration patterns**: Use view membership for organizational workflows

### Integration Examples

```terraform
# Get flag information including view membership
data "launchdarkly_feature_flag" "critical_flag" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = "payment-processing"
}

# Check if flag is in critical views
locals {
  critical_views = ["production-ready", "security-reviewed", "compliance-approved"]
  flag_views = toset(data.launchdarkly_feature_flag.critical_flag.views)
  missing_from_critical = setsubtract(toset(local.critical_views), local.flag_views)
}

# Alert if critical flag is missing from important views
output "compliance_check" {
  value = length(local.missing_from_critical) == 0 ? 
    "✅ Flag is in all critical views" : 
    "⚠️  Flag missing from: ${join(", ", local.missing_from_critical)}"
}

# Automatically add flag to required views
resource "launchdarkly_view_links" "ensure_critical_compliance" {
  for_each = local.missing_from_critical
  
  project_key = "example-project"
  view_key    = each.key
  
  flags = [data.launchdarkly_feature_flag.critical_flag.key]
  comment = "Auto-compliance: Adding critical flag to required view"
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Audit flag organization**: Use `views` to understand flag categorization
2. **Governance automation**: Implement rules based on view membership
3. **Team workflows**: Integrate view membership into CI/CD processes
4. **Documentation**: Output view membership for team visibility
