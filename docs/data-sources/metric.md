## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The unique key that references the metric. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `project_key` (String) The metrics's project key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.

### Read-Only

- `analysis_type` (String) The method for analyzing metric events. Available choices are `mean` and `percentile`.
- `description` (String) The description of the metric's purpose.
- `event_key` (String) The event key for your metric (if custom metric)
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `include_units_without_events` (Boolean) Include units that did not send any events and set their value to 0.
- `is_active` (Boolean, Deprecated) Ignored. All metrics are considered active.
- `is_numeric` (Boolean) Whether a `custom` metric is a numeric metric or not.
- `kind` (String) The metric type. Available choices are `click`, `custom`, and `pageview`.

- `name` (String) The human-friendly name for the metric.
- `percentile_value` (Number) The percentile for the analysis method. An integer denoting the target percentile between 0 and 100. Required when analysis_type is percentile.
- `randomization_units` (Set of String) A set of one or more context kinds that this metric can measure events from. Metrics can only use context kinds marked as "Available for experiments."
