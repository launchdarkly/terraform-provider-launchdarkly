# launchdarkly_segment (Data Source)

Provides a LaunchDarkly segment data source.

This data source allows you to retrieve segment information from your LaunchDarkly organization.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "launchdarkly_segment" "example" {
  key         = "example-segment"
  project_key = "example-project"
  env_key     = "example-env"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `env_key` (String) The segment's environment key.
- `key` (String) The unique key that references the segment.
- `project_key` (String) The segment's project key.

### Read-Only

- `creation_date` (Number) The segment's creation date represented as a UNIX epoch timestamp.
- `description` (String) The description of the segment's purpose.
- `excluded` (List of String) List of user keys excluded from the segment. To target on other context kinds, use the excluded_contexts block attribute. This attribute is not valid when `unbounded` is set to `true`.
- `excluded_contexts` (List of Object) List of non-user target objects excluded from the segment. This attribute is not valid when `unbounded` is set to `true`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--excluded_contexts))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `included` (List of String) List of user keys included in the segment. To target on other context kinds, use the included_contexts block attribute. This attribute is not valid when `unbounded` is set to `true`.
- `included_contexts` (List of Object) List of non-user target objects included in the segment. This attribute is not valid when `unbounded` is set to `true`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--included_contexts))
- `name` (String) The human-friendly name for the segment.
- `rules` (List of Object) List of nested custom rule blocks to apply to the segment. This attribute is not valid when `unbounded` is set to `true`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.
- `unbounded` (Boolean) Whether to create a standard segment (`false`) or a Big Segment (`true`). Standard segments include rule-based and smaller list-based segments. Big Segments include larger list-based segments and synced segments. Only use a Big Segment if you need to add more than 15,000 individual targets. It is not possible to manage the list of targeted contexts for Big Segments with Terraform.
- `unbounded_context_kind` (String) For Big Segments, the targeted context kind. If this attribute is not specified it will default to `user`.
