# launchdarkly_destination (Resource)

Provides a LaunchDarkly Data Export Destination resource.

-> **Note:** Data Export is available to customers on an Enterprise LaunchDarkly plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact LaunchDarkly Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

Data Export Destinations are locations that receive exported data. This resource allows you to configure destinations for the export of raw analytics data, including feature flag requests, analytics events, custom events, and more.

To learn more about data export, read [Data Export Documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations/data-export).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Currently the following five types of destinations are available: kinesis, google-pubsub, mparticle, azure-event-hubs, and segment. Please note that config fields will vary depending on which destination you are trying to configure / access.

resource "launchdarkly_destination" "kinesis_example" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  env_key     = "example-env"
  name        = "example-kinesis-dest"
  kind        = "kinesis"
  config = {
    region      = "us-east-1"
    role_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadmin"
    stream_name = "cat-stream"
  }
  on   = true
  tags = ["terraform"]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Map of String) The destination-specific configuration. To learn more, read [Destination-Specific Configs](#destination-specific-configs)
- `env_key` (String) The environment key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `kind` (String) The data export destination type. Available choices are `kinesis`, `google-pubsub`, `mparticle`, `azure-event-hubs`, and `segment`. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `name` (String) A human-readable name for your data export destination.
- `project_key` (String) The LaunchDarkly project key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.

### Optional

- `on` (Boolean) Whether the data export destination is on or not.
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

### Destination-Specific Configs

Depending on the destination kind, the `config` argument should contain the following fields:

#### Kinesis

- `region` - (Required) - AWS region your Kinesis resource resides in.

- `role_arn` - (Required) - Your AWS stream ARN in the format `"arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/{role}"`, ex. `"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadmin"`. Follow the directions in the [docs](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations/data-export/kinesis) to set up the necessary roles if need be.

## Import

You can import a data export destination using the destination's full ID in the format `project_key/environment_key/id`.

For example:

```sh
terraform import launchdarkly_destination.example example-project/example-env/57c0af609969090743529967
```
