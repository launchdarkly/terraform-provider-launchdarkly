# launchdarkly_view_links (Resource)

Provides a LaunchDarkly view links resource.

This resource allows you to create and manage links between views and feature flags within your LaunchDarkly organization. Views are used to organize and group related feature flags, making it easier for teams to manage flags by business context or deployment unit.

-> **Note:** This resource manages the linkage between views and flags. The view itself must be created separately using the `launchdarkly_view` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a view first
resource "launchdarkly_view" "frontend_team" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = "frontend-team"
  name        = "Frontend Team View"
  description = "View for frontend team feature flags"
}

# Link multiple flags to the view
resource "launchdarkly_view_links" "frontend_flags" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  view_key    = launchdarkly_view.frontend_team.key
  
  flags = [
    "header-redesign",
    "new-checkout-flow",
    "mobile-optimization"
  ]
  
  comment = "Linking frontend team flags to their view"
}

# Example with data source to dynamically get flag keys
data "launchdarkly_feature_flag" "checkout_flags" {
  for_each = toset(["checkout-v1", "checkout-v2", "payment-gateway"])
  
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = each.key
}

resource "launchdarkly_view_links" "checkout_view" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  view_key    = "checkout-view"
  
  flags = [for flag in data.launchdarkly_feature_flag.checkout_flags : flag.key]
  
  comment = "Managed by Terraform - Checkout team flags"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_key` (String) The project key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `view_key` (String) The view key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Optional comment for the link operations. Defaults to "Managed by Terraform".
- `flags` (Set of String) A set of feature flag keys to link to the view.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import view links using the format `project_key/view_key`.
terraform import launchdarkly_view_links.frontend_flags example-project/frontend-team
```

## Usage Notes

### Bulk Operations
This resource is designed for efficient bulk operations when linking many flags to a view. It's particularly useful for:

- **Team organization**: Link all flags managed by a specific team to their view
- **Feature grouping**: Group related flags for a feature or product area
- **Deployment coordination**: Organize flags by deployment unit or service

### State Management
The resource manages the complete set of flag links for a view. When you update the `flags` set:
- **Additions**: New flags are linked to the view
- **Removals**: Flags no longer in the set are unlinked from the view
- **Replacements**: The resource efficiently calculates the diff and makes minimal API calls

### Integration with Data Sources
You can use this resource with the discovery fields available in data sources:

```terraform
# Get a view and see what flags are linked to it
data "launchdarkly_view" "team_view" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = "team-view"
}

# The linked_flags field shows currently linked flags
output "current_flags" {
  value = data.launchdarkly_view.team_view.linked_flags
}

# Get a flag and see what views contain it
data "launchdarkly_feature_flag" "my_flag" {
  project_key = "example-project"
  key         = "my-flag"
}

# The views field shows which views contain this flag
output "flag_views" {
  value = data.launchdarkly_feature_flag.my_flag.views
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive comments**: Add meaningful comments to track why flags are linked
2. **Organize by team/context**: Group flags by logical business units or teams
3. **Leverage data sources**: Use flag and view data sources for dynamic linking
4. **Import existing links**: Use terraform import to manage existing flag-view relationships
