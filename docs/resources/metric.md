## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "launchdarkly_metric" "example" {
  project_key = launchdarkly_project.example.key
  key         = "example-metric"
  name        = "Example Metric"
  description = "Metric description."
  kind        = "pageview"
  tags        = ["example"]

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The unique key that references the metric. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `kind` (String) The metric type. Available choices are `click`, `custom`, and `pageview`. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `name` (String) The human-friendly name for the metric.
- `project_key` (String) The metrics's project key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.

### Optional

- `maintainer_id` (String) The LaunchDarkly member ID of the member who will maintain the metric. If not set, the API will automatically apply the member associated with your Terraform API key or the most recently-set maintainer
- `randomization_units` (Set of String) A set of one or more context kinds that this metric can measure events from. Metrics can only use context kinds marked as "Available for experiments." For more information, read [Allocating experiment audiences](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/creating-experiments/allocation).
- `selector` (String) The CSS selector for your metric (if click metric)
- `success_criteria` (String) The success criteria for your metric (if numeric metric)
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.
- `unit` (String) (Required for kind `custom`) The unit for numeric `custom` metrics.
- `urls` (Block List) List of nested `url` blocks describing URLs that you want to associate with the metric. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--urls))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--urls"></a>
### Nested Schema for `urls`

Required:

- `kind` (String) The URL type. Available choices are `exact`, `canonical`, `substring` and `regex`.

Optional:

- `pattern` (String) (Required for kind `regex`) The regex pattern to match by.

terraform import launchdarkly_metric.example example-project/example-metric-key
```
