# launchdarkly_environment (Resource)

Provides a LaunchDarkly environment resource.

This resource allows you to create and manage environments in your LaunchDarkly organization. This resource should _not_ be used if the encapsulated project is also managed via Terraform. In this case, you should _always_ use the nested environments config blocks on your `launchdarkly_project` resource to manage your environments.

-> **Note:** Mixing the use of nested `environments` blocks in the [`launchdarkly_project`] resource and `launchdarkly_environment` resources is not recommended.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "launchdarkly_environment" "staging" {
  name  = "Staging"
  key   = "staging"
  color = "ff00ff"
  tags  = ["terraform", "staging"]

  project_key = launchdarkly_project.example.key
}

resource "launchdarkly_environment" "approvals_example" {
  name  = "Approvals Example Environment"
  key   = "approvals-example"
  color = "ff00ff"
  tags  = ["terraform", "staging"]

  approval_settings {
    required                   = true
    can_review_own_request     = true
    min_num_approvals          = 2
    can_apply_declined_changes = true
  }

  project_key = launchdarkly_project.example.key
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `color` (String) The color swatch as an RGB hex value with no leading `#`. For example: `000000`
- `key` (String) The project-unique key for the environment. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `name` (String) The name of the environment.
- `project_key` (String) The LaunchDarkly project key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.

### Optional

- `approval_settings` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--approval_settings))
- `confirm_changes` (Boolean) Set to `true` if this environment requires confirmation for flag and segment changes. This field will default to `false` when not set.
- `critical` (Boolean) Denotes whether the environment is critical.
- `default_track_events` (Boolean) Set to `true` to enable data export for every flag created in this environment after you configure this argument. This field will default to `false` when not set. To learn more, read [Data Export](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/data-export).
- `default_ttl` (Number) The TTL for the environment. This must be between 0 and 60 minutes. The TTL setting only applies to environments using the PHP SDK. This field will default to `0` when not set. To learn more, read [TTL settings](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/environments#ttl-settings).
- `require_comments` (Boolean) Set to `true` if this environment requires comments for flag and segment changes. This field will default to `false` when not set.
- `secure_mode` (Boolean) Set to `true` to ensure a user of the client-side SDK cannot impersonate another user. This field will default to `false` when not set.
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.

### Read-Only

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) The environment's SDK key.
- `client_side_id` (String, Sensitive) The environment's client-side ID.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `mobile_key` (String, Sensitive) The environment's mobile key.

### Nested Schema for `approval_settings`

Optional:

- `auto_apply_approved_changes` (Boolean) Automatically apply changes that have been approved by all reviewers. This field is only applicable for approval service kinds other than `launchdarkly`.
- `can_apply_declined_changes` (Boolean) Set to `true` if changes can be applied as long as the `min_num_approvals` is met, regardless of whether any reviewers have declined a request. Defaults to `true`.
- `can_review_own_request` (Boolean) Set to `true` if requesters can approve or decline their own request. They may always comment. Defaults to `false`.
- `min_num_approvals` (Number) The number of approvals required before an approval request can be applied. This number must be between 1 and 5. Defaults to 1.
- `required` (Boolean) Set to `true` for changes to flags in this environment to require approval. You may only set `required` to true if `required_approval_tags` is not set and vice versa. Defaults to `false`.
- `required_approval_tags` (List of String) An array of tags used to specify which flags with those tags require approval. You may only set `required_approval_tags` if `required` is not set to `true` and vice versa.
- `service_config` (Map of String) The configuration for the service associated with this approval. This is specific to each approval service. For a `service_kind` of `servicenow`, the following fields apply:

	 - `template` (String) The sys_id of the Standard Change Request Template in ServiceNow that LaunchDarkly will use when creating the change request.
	 - `detail_column` (String) The name of the ServiceNow Change Request column LaunchDarkly uses to populate detailed approval request information. This is most commonly "justification".
- `service_kind` (String) The kind of service associated with this approval. This determines which platform is used for requesting approval. Valid values are `servicenow`, `launchdarkly`. If you use a value other than `launchdarkly`, you must have already configured the integration in the LaunchDarkly UI or your apply will fail.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import a LaunchDarkly environment using this format: `project_key/environment_key`.
terraform import launchdarkly_environment.staging example-project/staging
```
