## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Map of String) The set of configuration fields corresponding to the value defined for `integration_key`. Refer to the `formVariables` field in the corresponding `integrations/<integration_key>/manifest.json` file in [this repo](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/tree/master/integrations) for a full list of fields for the integration you wish to configure. **IMPORTANT**: Please note that Terraform will only accept these in snake case, regardless of the case shown in the manifest.
- `integration_key` (String) The integration key. Supported integration keys are `cloudtrail`, `datadog`, `dynatrace`, `elastic`, `grafana`, `honeycomb`, `logdna`, `msteams`, `new-relic-apm`, `signalfx`, `slack`, and `splunk`. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `name` (String) A human-friendly name for your audit log subscription viewable from within the LaunchDarkly Integrations page.
- `on` (Boolean) Whether or not you want your subscription enabled, i.e. to actively send events.
- `statements` (Block List, Min: 1) A block representing the resources to which you wish to subscribe. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--statements))

### Optional

- `tags` (Set of String) Tags associated with your resource.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--statements"></a>
### Nested Schema for `statements`

Required:

- `effect` (String) Either `allow` or `deny`. This argument defines whether the statement allows or denies access to the named resources and actions.

Optional:

- `actions` (List of String) The list of action specifiers defining the actions to which the statement applies.
Either `actions` or `not_actions` must be specified. For a list of available actions read [Actions reference](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/custom-roles/actions#actions-reference).
- `not_actions` (List of String) The list of action specifiers defining the actions to which the statement does not apply.
- `not_resources` (List of String) The list of resource specifiers defining the resources to which the statement does not apply.
- `resources` (List of String) The list of resource specifiers defining the resources to which the statement applies.
