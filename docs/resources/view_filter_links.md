# launchdarkly_view_filter_links (Resource)

Provides a LaunchDarkly view filter links resource for linking resources to views using filter expressions.

This resource allows you to link all flags and/or segments matching a filter expression to a specific view. The filter is resolved at apply time — the backend finds all resources matching the filter and links them to the view.

-> **Note:** Filter-based links are point-in-time. By default, filters are resolved only when this resource is created or updated (for example, when `flag_filter` changes). Set `reconcile_on_apply = true` to force re-resolution on every `terraform apply`.

## When to use which resource

- **`view_links`**: You know the exact flag/segment keys to link. Terraform tracks the explicit list and detects drift if links are removed externally.
- **`view_filter_links` (this resource)**: You want to link all resources matching a dynamic query (e.g. all flags tagged "frontend"). No drift detection on resolved keys. By default, only resource argument changes trigger updates; set `reconcile_on_apply` to refresh links every apply.
- **`view_keys` on individual resources**: Each flag/segment declares its own view membership. Best for modular Terraform structures.

-> **Warning:** Do not use `view_filter_links` and `view_links` targeting the same view and resource type, as conflicts may cause unexpected behavior.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Link all flags tagged "frontend" to a view
resource "launchdarkly_view_filter_links" "frontend_flags" {
  project_key = "my-project"
  view_key    = "frontend-team"
  flag_filter = "tags:frontend"
}

# Link both flags and segments matching a tag
resource "launchdarkly_view_filter_links" "platform_resources" {
  project_key                   = "my-project"
  view_key                      = "platform-team"
  flag_filter                   = "tags:platform"
  segment_filter                = "tags:platform"
  segment_filter_environment_id = launchdarkly_project.my_project.environments[0].client_side_id
}

# Link only segments matching a filter
resource "launchdarkly_view_filter_links" "beta_segments" {
  project_key                   = "my-project"
  view_key                      = "beta-program"
  segment_filter                = "tags:beta"
  segment_filter_environment_id = launchdarkly_project.my_project.environments[0].client_side_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_key` (String) The project key. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.
- `view_key` (String) The view key to link resources to. A change in this field will force the destruction of the existing resource and the creation of a new one.

### Optional

- `flag_filter` (String) A filter expression to match feature flags for linking to the view. Uses the same filter syntax as the flag list API endpoint (e.g. `tags:frontend`, `status:active`).
- `reconcile_on_apply` (Boolean) Whether to re-resolve configured filters on every `terraform apply` even when no resource arguments changed. When true, Terraform will show an in-place update on each apply and `resolved_at` will change every run.
- `segment_filter` (String) A filter expression to match segments for linking to the view. Uses the segment query filter syntax (e.g. `tags anyOf ["backend"]`, `query = "my-segment"`, `unbounded = true`). Requires `segment_filter_environment_id` to be set.
- `segment_filter_environment_id` (String) The environment ID to use when resolving segment filters. Required when `segment_filter` is set. This is the environment's opaque ID (e.g. from `launchdarkly_project.environments[*].client_side_id`).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `resolved_at` (String) Timestamp of the last successful filter resolution. This value updates when the resource is created or updated, and on every apply when `reconcile_on_apply` is true.
