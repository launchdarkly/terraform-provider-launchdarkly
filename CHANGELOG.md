## [1.6.0] (July 20, 2021)

FEATURES:

- Added support for an `azure-event-hubs` data source `kind` on the `launchdarkly_destination` resource.

ENHANCEMENTS:

- Improved 429 retry handling.

- Upgraded the Go version to 1.16.

- Upgraded the LaunchDarkly SDK version to v5.1.0+.

BUG FIXES:

- Fixed a bug in the feature flag resource where multivariate (non-boolean) resource config with zero variations would create a boolean flag.

- Fixed a bug in the feature flag resource where `default_on_variation` and `default_off_variation` would still show up in `terraform plan` following their removal.

- Updated the destination `config` `Elem` type to `TypeString` and made the `config` field required. Added improved validation to check fields for different destination kinds.

NOTES:

- The `launchdarkly_destination` resource's `enabled` argument has been deprecated in favor of `on`. Please update your config to use `on` in order to maintain compatibility with future versions.
- The `launchdarkly_webhook` resource's `policy_statements` argument has been deprecated in favor of `statements`. Please update your config to use `statements` in order to maintain compatibility with future versions.
- The `launchdarkly_webhook` data source's `policy_statements` attribute has been deprecated in favor of `statements`. Please update all references of `policy_statements` to `statements` in order to maintain compatibility with future versions.
- The `launchdarkly_webhook` resource's `enabled` argument has been deprecated in favor of `on`. Please update your config to use `on` in order to maintain compatibility with future versions.
- The `launchdarkly_webhook` data source's `enabled` attribute has been deprecated in favor of `on`. Please update your all references of `enabled` to `on` in order to maintain compatibility with future versions.

## [1.5.1] (March 16, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

- Fixed a bug preventing number and boolean values in targeting rules clauses from working. The new `value_type` attribute must be set in order to utilize number and boolean values. All values for a given targeting rule clause must be of the same type. [#51](https://github.com/launchdarkly/terraform-provider-launchdarkly/issues/51)

## [1.5.0] (September 29, 2020)

FEATURES:

- Added a `launchdarkly_project` data source.

- Added a `launchdarkly_environment` data source.

- Added a `launchdarkly_feature_flag` data source.

- Added a `launchdarkly_feature_flag_environment` data source.

- Added a `launchdarkly_segment` data source.

- Added a `launchdarkly_webhook` data source.

ENHANCEMENTS:

- Upgraded the LaunchDarkly API version to 3.5.0.

BUG FIXES:

- Resolved issues with the `launchdarkly_project`'s `environments` attribute. This attribute is no longer marked as deprecated and should be used when you wish to override the behavior of creating `Test` and `Production` environments during project creation.

- Fixed a bug where creating a `launchdarkly_feature_flag_environment` with an `off_variation` was not actually setting the off variation.

NOTES:

- The `launchdarkly_project`'s `environments` attribute is no longer marked as `computed`. This means that if you have `launchdarkly_project` resources without nested `environments` that were created before this version, you will see a diff denoting the removal of the computed environments from your state. It is safe to apply this change as no changes be made to your LaunchDarkly resources when applied.

## [1.4.1] (September 8, 2020)
