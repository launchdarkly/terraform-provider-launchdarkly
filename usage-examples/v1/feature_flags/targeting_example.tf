# The rules block of this resource determines that the 0-index variation ("string1") will
# be served to users whose names start with the letters a-e.
# flag_fallthrough describes the default to serve if none of the other rules apply:
# in this case, the percentage of users who will be served each variation (must sum to 100000).
# Use of the bucket_by attribute ensures that all users with the same company will be served the 
# same variation within the rollout buckets.
